While Abby continued to study the paranormal at a technical college with eccentric engineer Jillian Holtzmann, Erin, now a professor at Columbia University, disowned the work, fearing it will impact her tenure.

    Movie(image: #imageLiteral(resourceName: "2"), rating: 4, title: "Goodfellas", subtitle: "1990", description: "In 1955, Henry Hill, a high school student, becomes enamored of the criminal life in his neighborhood, and begins working for Paul \"Paulie\" Cicero and his associates: James \"Jimmy the Gent\" Conway, a truck hijacker; and Tommy DeVito, a fellow juvenile delinquent. Henry begins as fence for Jimmy, gradually working his way up to more serious crimes. Enjoying the perks of their criminal life, the three associates spend most of their nights at the Copacabana nightclub, carousing with women. Henry meets and later marries Karen Friedman, a Jewish woman from the Five Towns area of Long Island. Karen is initially troubled by Henry's criminal activities, but is soon seduced by his glamorous lifestyle.\n\nIn 1970, Billy Batts, a mobster in the Gambino crime family, repeatedly insults Tommy at a nightclub owned by Henry. Enraged, Tommy and Jimmy attack and kill him. Knowing their murder of a made man would mean retribution from the Gambinos, which could possibly include Paulie being ordered to kill them, Jimmy, Henry, and Tommy cover up the murder. They transport the body in the trunk of Henry's car, and bury it in upstate New York. Six months later, Jimmy learns that the burial site is slated for development, forcing them to exhume the decomposing corpse and move it.\n\nHenry decides to live with Janice, but Paulie insists he returns to Karen after completing a job for him. Henry and Jimmy are sent to collect a debt from a gambler in Tampa, but they are arrested after being turned in by the gambler's sister, a typist for the FBI. Jimmy and Henry receive ten-year prison sentences. In prison, Henry sells drugs smuggled in by Karen to support his family on the outside. In 1978, Henry is paroled, and expands his cocaine trade against Paulie's orders, soon involving Jimmy and Tommy. Jimmy organizes a crew to raid the Lufthansa vault at John F. Kennedy International Airport and take $6 million. After some of the crew buy expensive items in spite of Jimmy's orders and the getaway truck is found by police, he has most of the crew murdered. Tommy and Henry are spared from Jimmy's wrath, but Tommy is eventually killed by the Gambinos in retribution for Batts' murder, having been fooled into thinking he would become a made man.\n\nIn 1980, Henry has become a nervous wreck from cocaine use and insomnia. He tries to organize a drug deal with his associates in Pittsburgh, but he is arrested by narcotics agents, and jailed. After he is bailed out, Karen explains that she flushed $60,000 worth of cocaine down the toilet to prevent FBI agents from finding it during their raid, leaving the family virtually penniless. Feeling betrayed by Henry's drug dealing, Paulie gives him $3,200, and ends their association. Facing federal charges and realizing that Jimmy is planning to have him killed, Henry decides to enroll in the Witness Protection Program. He gives sufficient testimony to have Paulie and Jimmy arrested and convicted. Forced out of his gangster life, Henry now has to face living in the real world. He narrates \"I'm an average nobody. I get to live the rest of my life like a schnook\".\n\nThe end title cards reveal that Henry is still in the Witness Protection Program and in 1987, he was arrested in Seattle for narcotics conspiracy and he received five years probation. Since then, Henry has been clean. After 25 years of marriage, Henry and Karen separated in 1989. Paul Cicero died in 1988 in Fort Worth Federal Prison at the age of 73 due to respiratory illness. Jimmy Conway is serving a 20 years to life sentence in a New York prison for murder and that he would not be eligible for parole until 2004 when he would be 78 years old."),
